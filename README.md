2. [React Native Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/install/) To save your keys word and utilize that wherever you need.

3. [React Native Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation/) Includes Stack && Tab Navigation.

4. [React Native Net Info](https://github.com/react-native-netinfo/react-native-netinfo) An awesome and simple library to catch the connectivity and show to the user when has troubles with the internet. They provide you some hooks to reach them.

5. [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) Instead of Fetch.

6. [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/getting-started) This library replace Redux Form, it's an awesome way to handle forms and actually works very well in React Native.

7. [React Native BootSplash](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash)  In this template you only have to change the image in ./assets/splash/splash.png and run again `npx react-native generate-bootsplash ./assets/splash/andTheNameOfyourNewImage.png` . If you need an animatation I recomend you watch examples in YouTube. Read the doc, you can add some props when run the command in the Terminal.

8. [React Native Device Info](https://github.com/react-native-device-info/react-native-device-info) Provides you a lot of information about the device of the user, for example, if the device has a notch or not, and take styles decisions from there. Gives you some hooks too.

9. [React Native FastImage](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) For catching images like browers instead of `<Image />`component from `'react-native'` . Works really well when you need to call heavy images from your backend.

10. [Babel Module Resolver](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver/blob/master/DOCS.md) For global imports like `import {Container} from '@components'` instead of `../../../../../components`

11. [React Native Responsive Screen](https://github.com/marudy/react-native-responsive-screen) When Flex doesn't help you, this library figure out the problem of responsive sizes. You only have to pass a number of porcentage.

# üöÄ How does it works?
## üõ£ Three ways:

1- [React Native Rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rename) In the main root, you have to run a command (Pls read the doc) and that's it, your project gonna be renewed. Pay attention, not always works great. Sometimes has some issues in the android folder.

2- Create a new project from `npx react-native init name-project --template https://github.com/iviveros-code/boilerplate-react-native` . Great Option!

3- Maybe you want to visualize in your emulator the flow, for that you have to clone this repo and run `npm install`or `yarn install` and if is iOS `cd ios && pod install & cd ..`, then `npx react-native run-ios` or `npx react-native run-android` o if you use yarn `yarn ios`or `yarn android`.

# üå≥ What structure do I propose?

# ‚Åá Why ‚Åá

Because you need to be structured at the moment to set up a new project, assets need to be outside the main folder because you don't need extra size. 
Inside the src main folder, you have some folders with the same "status" like app, config, constants, hooks, services, theme, utils. 
Inside the app folder, you have components (global re-utilizable components, if the component only affects one specific screen they must be inside the component folder inside the specific screen for example `login/components/Form`. Then have a context, navigation of the entire app and the screens folder.
